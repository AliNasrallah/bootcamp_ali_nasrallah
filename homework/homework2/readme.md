# Stock Portfolio Optimization

## Problem Statement

A major challenge in stock portfolio management is striking the right balance between risk and return. Risk and volatility make it difficult to determine the optimal capital allocation distribution across a stock portfolio. The goal of this project is to build a model that optimizes capital allocation across a user's stock portfolio by maximizing risk-adjusted returns using historical market data.
